<h1>README file</h1>
<p>Here is some information about the files for this project:</p>

<ul>

  <li><code>cardsBasic.py</code>  this is the module that contains the
  Card and Deck class. You need this for everything you do for this
  project </li>

  <li><code>cardsDemo.py</code>   this is a file that "plays around"
  with the Card and Deck class. It shows you the kinds of things you
  can do with these classes, but it does not really do anything
  interesting but show off <code> cardsBasic.py </code> </li>

  <li> <code>seahaven.py</code>   If you want to play the demo game
  (the kind of game you are supposed to turn in), you need this
  file. You start to play the game by starting Python on this file. </li> 

  <li> <code> seahaven_3_2.pyc</code>  or <code>
   seahaven_3_3.pyc</code> you need one of these files. The first file if you are running
  Python3.2, the second if you are running Python3.3. If you don't
  know, take both of them and the <code> seahaven.py </code> will
  figure out which one to use .</li>

  <li> <code> seahavenStart.py </code> This file can be used as an
  outline of you functions you need to create for this project. All
  the of functions are there, including parameters and comments. You
  much replace the functions whose body consists of <code> pass
  </code> with functional content. This file does contain some working
  functions like the <code> print_game</code>, <code> print_rules
  </code> which you are free to use. There is also a skeleton <code>
  play </code> function which has the command loop and can be set up
  to call the correct function for each command. You should be able to
  run this file, though it will not <b>do</b> anything until you fix the functions.</li>
  
</ul>
