// Welcome to a tour of the Go programming language.
// 
// The tour is divided into three sections: basic concepts, methods and interfaces, and concurrency.
// 
// Throughout the tour you will find a series of exercises for you to complete.
// 
// The tour is interactive. Click the Run button now (or type Shift-Enter) to compile and run the program on a remote server. The result is displayed below the code.
// 
// These example programs demonstrate different aspects of Go. The programs in the tour are meant to be starting points for your own experimentation.
// 
// Edit the program and run it again.
// 
// Whenever you're ready to move on, click the Next button or type the PageDown key.
